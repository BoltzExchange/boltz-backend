  Deploying Boltz backend has to be done with great care since it will have full
  control over the Lightning Node it is connected to. With great power comes
  great responsibility.
---

# ðŸš¢ Backend Deployment

Prerequisites:

- The latest
  [Node.js LTS and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
  installed. We recommend using
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to manage npm
  installs: `nvm install --lts`
- [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync) (needed to compile the `TypeScript`
  code)

Boltz Backend requires a synced Bitcoin Core Instance to connect to the Bitcoin
mainchain. Similarly, Elements Core to connect to the Liquid sidechain etc.
Bitcoin/Elements Core must:

- Have the transaction index enabled: `txindex=1`
- Enable ZeroMQ streams for raw blocks and raw transactions:
  (`zmqpubrawblock=tcp://<host>:<port>` and `zmqpubrawtx=tcp://<host>:<port>`)

Boltz requires a [LND](https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd) or
[CLN](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/) node running on Bitcoin to
be present. For LND, no special configuration is needed, all
[official release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases)
are compatible.

## Config Sample

```toml
configpath = "/home/boltz/.boltz/boltz.conf"

# but the claim and refund keys are derived from it

## Database migrations

To migrate from an SQLite database to PostgreSQL, use the following script with
[pgloader](https://pgloader.io/):

```
load database
    from sqlite://<path>
    into pgsql://<user>:<password>>@<host>/<database>

with quote identifiers, data only, reset sequences

set work_mem to '16MB', maintenance_work_mem to '512 MB';
```
