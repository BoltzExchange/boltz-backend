  This document gives an overview of how Boltz API clients should verify
  information generated by Boltz and other general measurements that should be
  undertaken to minimize trust.

# ðŸš« Don't trust. Verify!

## Basics

As a general concept, Boltz API clients should not trust any critical information obtained via the Boltz API. This applies _especially_ to chain addresses and lightning invoices where users will send bitcoin to.

## UTXO Chain address verification

Boltz currently supports two types of outputs and addresses:

* P2SH nested P2WSH
* P2WSH

Boltz uses P2SH nested P2WSH addresses for Normal Submarine Swaps and P2WSH addresses for Reverse Submarine Swaps.

Boltz API returns a redeem script and a derived chain address when creating swaps. After verifying that the redeem script is valid (checking preimage hash, public key, timeout block height of the HTLC and OP codes), Boltz API clients should verify the correctness of the address:

#### P2SH nested P2WSH

Although the output script of the P2SH nested P2WSH addresses is the same as the one of plain P2SH addresses, other data is hashed. Here, not the plain redeem script is hashed, but a P2WSH output script is constructed and hashed first with SHA256 and then with RIPEMD-160 as if it was the redeem script. The output script will look like this:

```
OP_HASH160
<hash of the P2WSH output script>
OP_EQUAL
```

#### P2WSH

In P2WSH addresses the reedem script is only hashed with SHA256. The output script is also a little simpler:

```
OP_0
<hash of the redeem script>
```

#### Examples

Examples for generating all of these addresses with `Node.js` can be found in the [`boltz-core`](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-core/blob/master/lib/swap/Scripts.ts) reference library.

> Note: Address verfication applies to all swap types involving a UTXO chain. An exhaustive list of Bitcoin mainchain Opcodes with description can be found on the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script).

## Lightning Invoice Verification

Boltz API Clients should decode and verify that a Lightning invoice generated by Boltz

* Has the same SHA256 hash that the client previously generated and used to call `/createswap`.
* Has the exact same amount than the amount used to call `/createswap`
* Hake sure amount in api response from `/createswap` are as expected, before showing invoice to user

An example in JavaScript can be found [here](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-web-app/blob/main/src/utils/validation.js).

> Note: Lightning invoice verification applies to Reverse Submarine Swaps only.

## EVM Chain Contract Verification

TODO

## General Measurements

* Swap amounts should be pre-calculated by the API client (taking into account network fee, Boltz fee from `/getpairs`) and verified against responses from Boltz API
