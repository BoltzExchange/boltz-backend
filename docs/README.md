# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## Instances

We offer Boltz on [testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange) for development & testing purposes and our production service on [mainnet](https://boltz.exchange).

The corresponding REST APIs can be accessed at:

* Testnet: `https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/`
* Mainnet: `https://api.boltz.exchange/`

> Note: To access the API via browser, simply append an [endpoint](api.md) to the address, e.g.:
>
> [`https://api.boltz.exchange/version`](https://api.boltz.exchange/version)

In the following section we'll walk through existing swap types & states and then describe the REST API in the next section.
