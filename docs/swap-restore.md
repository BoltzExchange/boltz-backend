# 🛟 Swap Restore

Swap Restore is a recovery flow for situations where a swap client lost all
local swap state and backups. Swap Restore enables refunding failed swaps as
well as resuming ongoing swaps using a simple mnemonic known as the **Boltz
Rescue Key**.

Swap Restore targets UTXO chains. On EVM chains, swap parameters are persisted
onchain in contract event logs. Recovery on EVM is performed by reading those
logs instead of using Swap Restore. For more details, see the
[EVM contract logs section](./claiming-swaps.md#evm-chains).

## What Swap Restore Does

At a high level, Swap Restore means the swap client derives the xpub used for
swaps from the mnemonic and submits it to `/v2/swap/restore`, receives all
associated swaps, and reconstructs the local data. With that state restored, the
app can perform claims for ongoing swaps or refunds for failed ones as needed.
For claims to work, the client also needs to be able to deterministically derive
preimages. One option to do that is to
[hash the private key of a swap and use that hash as the preimage](#preimages).

## Trust Model

The private keys never leave the device and remain client-side. The backend only
receives the xpub, which cannot be used to derive private keys or spend funds.
All transaction signing happens locally. Sharing an xpub reveals your swap
history to Boltz's backend, but it cannot spend your funds.

## API

Call
[`POST /v2/swap/restore`](https://api.boltz.exchange/swagger#/Swap/post_swap_restore)
with the xpub in the request body:

```json
{
  "xpub": "xpub6C..."
}
```

The API will respond with an array of swaps belonging to that xpub. A simplified
example shape is shown below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "type": "submarine|reverse|chain",
    "status": "transaction.lockupFailed",
    "from": "BTC",
    "to": "LBTC",
    ...
  }
]
```

## Key Derivation

Starting from a mnemonic, derive a seed and then a BIP32 root. From there,
derive the account at `m/44/0/0/0` (the default path) and export its xpub for
server-side swap matching. Individual swap keys are derived at
`m/44/0/0/0/{index}`. This default path must be used for compatibility with
[Boltz Web App](https://boltz.exchange/rescue/external?mode=rescue-key), though
a different derivation path can be specified when using the
[Boltz API](https://api.boltz.exchange/swagger#/Swap/post_swap_restore)
directly.

### BIP85: Avoiding Derivation Path Collisions

For wallets that already use standard derivation paths like `m/44/0/0/0` for
regular transactions, using the same path for swap keys creates a risk of
derivation path collisions. If the wallet later generates keys at the same
indices for regular spending, it could inadvertently reuse keys that were
previously used in swaps, compromising both privacy and security.

[BIP85](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawiki) provides
a solution by deriving application-specific entropy from a master seed. This
entropy can then be used to create a child seed exclusively for Boltz swaps,
isolating swap keys from the wallet's main key derivation tree without requiring
users to back up any additional information.

#### Implementation

1. Derive entropy from the master seed via BIP85 using the application number
   for Boltz (e.g., `26589` for "BOLTZ" in T9)
2. Use the derived entropy to create a seed
3. From this derived child seed, derive the swap account at `m/44/0/0/0` and
   export its xpub
4. All swap keys and preimages are then derived from this isolated child seed

This approach ensures that:

- Swap keys never collide with the main wallet's key derivation
- The entire swap key hierarchy is deterministically recoverable from the master
  mnemonic
- Privacy is preserved by separating swap activity from regular wallet activity
- The same master mnemonic can safely be used across both regular wallet
  operations and Boltz swaps

### Preimages

We recommend deriving preimages deterministically with
`sha256(privateKey(index))`. This allows swaps to be fully restored from the
mnemonic alone. Using deterministic preimages in this exact way is necessary for
restored swaps to be claimable in our Web App.
