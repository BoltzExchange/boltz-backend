# Boltz v2.0.0 Documentation

This is the documentation of [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange) version 2.0.0.

## What is Boltz

Boltz is an instant, non-custodial crypto currency exchange that focuses on privacy and the adoption of second layer scaling technologies like the [lightning network](http://lightning.network/). Boltz does not require an account or any other personal data, nor does it use trackers to log data that could identify users.

## Instances

We are running and maintaining two Boltz instances that can be used - one on [testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange) and one on [mainnet](https://boltz.exchange).

The Rest API can be accessed at:

* [Testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api)
* [Mainnet](https://boltz.exchange/api)
