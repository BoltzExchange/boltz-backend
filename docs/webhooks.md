# ü™ù Webhooks

To get the latest status of your swaps, you can poll the status endpoints of the
REST API, subscribe to the WebSocket, or set a webhook when creating the swap.

To register a webhook add the following object to the request that creates the
swap:

```json
{
  ...
  "webhook": {
    "url": "<URL that should called>",
    "hashSwapId": false
  }
}
```

`url` will be called on every swap status update with a JSON object structured
like this:

```json
{
  "event": "swap.update",
  "data": {
    "id": "<swap id>",
    "status": "<new status of the swap>"
  }
}
```

Only HTTPS URLs are allowed for webhooks. `hashSwapId` is optional and defaults
to false. When it is explicitly set to `true`, the swap id is hashed with SHA256
and encoded as HEX in the webhook call. That is useful when the webhook is
processed by a third party to which you do not want to leak information about
your swaps.
