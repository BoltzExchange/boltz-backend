# Boltz v3.1.5 Documentation

This is the documentation of [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange) version 3.1.5.

## What is Boltz

Boltz is a privacy first, account-free crypto exchange built on top of second layer scaling technologies like the [lightning network](http://lightning.network/). Boltz doesn't track any data that could potentially be traced back to the identity of our users.

## Instances

We are running and maintaining two Boltz instances that can be used - one on [testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange) and one on [mainnet](https://boltz.exchange).technology/).

The Rest API can be accessed at:

* [Testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api)
* [Mainnet](https://boltz.exchange/api)

> Note: If you access the API from your browser, you will get 404.
> Run `curl https://boltz.exchange/api/version`, (or `curl https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/version` for testnet) to check that it is available.
