  Boltz exposes a RESTful HTTP API that can be used to query information like
  supported pairs as well as to create and monitor swaps. This page lists all
  available endpoints and shows how to use them.
---

# ðŸ¤– REST API

### Response and request encoding

All the responses to all calls are encoded as `JSON` objects. If endpoints require the client to provide any kind of arguments these also have to be encoded as `JSON` and sent in the body of a `POST` request. Make sure to set the `Content-Type` header of your `POST` requests to `application/json` if you are sending `JSON` encoded data in the body of the request.

### Error handling

If a call fails for some reason the returned [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_HTTP\_status\_codes) will indicate that, and an object will be returned that looks like this and gives the reason why the call failed:

```json
{
  "error": "message explaining why the call failed"
}
```

## Backend Version

Returns the version of [Boltz Backend](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-backend).

| URL            | Response    |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /version` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`

Response object:

* `version`: the deployed version of Boltz Backend

**Examples:**

`GET /version`

```json
{
  "version":"3.2.1-7c38088"
}
```

## Supported Pairs

In order to create a swap, one first has to know which pairs are supported and what kind of rates, limits and fees are applied when creating a new swap. The following call returns this information.

| URL             | Response    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /getpairs` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`

Response object:

* `info`: contains information about special configuration parameters of the Boltz Backend deployment. As of writing this there is only one possible value:
  * `prepay.minerfee`: If the array contains this value, the corresponding Boltz instance requires a small invoice for the miner fee to be paid before the actual hold invoice of a Reverse Swap is revealed. As of writing, our [mainnet instance](https://boltz.exchange/) does not require this prepayment and thus returns an empty array.
* `warnings`: an array of strings that indicate that some feature of Boltz might me disabled or restricted. An example of a warning is:
  * `reverse.swaps.disabled`: Means that all reverse swaps (from Lightning to the chain) are disabled.
* `pairs`: an object containing the supported pairs. The keys of the values are the IDs of the pairs (`BTC/BTC` is a special case with mainchain Bitcoin as _base asset_ and Lightning Bitcoin as _quote asset_) and the values itself contain information about the pair:
  * `hash`: SHA256 hash of the `JSON` encoded data in the pair object.
  * `rate`: The exchange rate of the pair.
  * `limits`: a `JSON` Object containing the minimal and maximal amount of the pair's swap. The numbers are denominated **10 \*\* -8** of the _quote asset._
    * `maximalZeroConf`: The maximal amounts that will be accepted without chain confirmations by Boltz.
  * `fees`: A `JSON` object that contains different kinds of fees:
    * `percentage`: The percentage of the "send amount" that is charged by Boltz as "Boltz Fee" for swaps from quote to base asset (e.g. Lightning -> Bitcoin).
    * `percentageSwapIn`: The percentage of the "send amount" that is charged by Boltz as "Boltz Fee" for a swap from base to quote asset (e.g. Bitcoin -> Lightning).
    * `minerFees`: The network fees charged for locking up and claiming funds onchain. These values are absolute, denominated in **10 \*\* -8** of the quote asset.

**Examples:**

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

      "capacity": 369879555
    }
  }
}
```

## Swap Timeouts

Boltz Swaps have different timeouts for each pair. This endpoint allows querying those timeouts denominated in blocks of the base and quote chain.

| URL             | Response    |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /timeouts` | JSON object |

        "swapMaximal": 288
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Swap Contracts

To query the addresses of contracts used by Boltz for swaps on EVM chains like [RSK](https://rootstock.io/), the following endpoint can be queried:

| URL                 | Response    |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /getcontracts` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`

Response object:

* `rsk`: a `JSON` object that contains all relevant RSK addresses
  * `network`: `JSON` object that contains information about the network
    * `chainId`: id of the RSK chain
    * `name`: if the RSK network of the backend is public, this property will be set to its name. Else this value stays `undefined`.
  * `swapContracts`: `JSON` object containing swap contract addresses as values
  * `tokens`: `JSON` object with the ticker symbol of the supported token as key and its address as value

**Examples:**

`GET /getcontracts`

Response:

```json
{
  "rsk": {
    "network": {
      "chainId": 1337
    },
    "swapContracts": {
      "rBTCSwap": "0x0",
      "TokenSwap": "0x0"
    },
    "tokens": {
    }
  }
}
```

## Fee Estimations

Boltz provides an API endpoint that returns fee estimations for all supported chains. These fee estimations are _not_ enforced by Boltz and merely represent a recommendation.

For UTXO chains like Bitcoin it is important to mention that if 0-conf is accepted by Boltz  for a particular pair (see [section](api.md#getting-pairs) above) and to be used with Normal Submarine Swaps, the lockup transaction has to have at least 80% of the recommended `sat/vbyte` value. One can read more about the what and why in the [0-conf docs](0-confirmation.md).

| URL                     | Response    |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /getfeeestimation` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`

Response object:

This endpoint returns a `JSON` object of which each key is the symbol of a chain and each value the estimated fee for that chain denominated in `sat/vbyte` for UTXO chains like Bitcoin or `GWEI` for EVM chains like RSK.

**Examples:**

`GET /getfeeestimation`

Response:

```json
{
  "BTC": 16,
  "L-BTC": 0.11
}
```

## Raw Transactions

Boltz API also allows for querying raw transactions of all supported UTXO chains, irrespective of whether the transactions are still in the mempool or already included in a block. Note, that Boltz does _not_ provide any kind of cryptographic proof that the transaction was included in a block. Also this call is primarily kept for backward compatibility with integrations, it is not needed to construct transactions as the response of [`/swapstatus`](api.md#status-of-a-swap) provides all necessary info.

Requests querying for transactions have to be `POST` and contain two arguments in its JSON encoded body:

* `currency`: which chain should be queried for the transaction
* `transactionId`: the id of the transaction that should be queried

| URL                    | Response    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `POST /gettransaction` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `400 Bad Request`: if an argument wasn't provided or the transaction can't be found

Response object:

* `transactionHex`: the requested transaction encoded in hex

**Examples:**

`POST /gettransaction`

Request body:

```json
{
  "currency": "BTC",
  "transactionId": "0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
	"transactionHex": "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000"
}
```

## Lockup Transactions

The following endpoint can be used to query the user's lockup transaction of a Normal Submarine Swap on UTXO chains. The request has to be `POST` and contain the following argument in the `JSON` encoded body:

* `id`: id of the Submarine Swap

| URL                        | Response    |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `POST /getswaptransaction` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `400 Bad Request`: if an argument wasn't provided, or the Submarine Swap can't be found

Response object:

* `transactionHex`: the lockup transaction of the Normal Submarine Swap encoded in hex
* `timeoutBlockHeight`: block height at which the HTLC in the lockup transaction will time out

If the HTLC has not timed out yet, there will be an additional value in the response:

* `timeoutEta`: UNIX timestamp at which the HTLC is expected to time out

**Examples:**

`POST /getswaptransaction`

Request body:

```json
{
  "id": "KR8XaB"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "transactionHex": "020000000001015bf3fe03071edae971276831963d45821ce6bc95c567fd7832bee3b1848254ba0000000000feffffff02b82a75e80000000017a914ca9b26af0865c2a59f0d6c41ede68f03264a52398700e1f5050000000017a914d2271732308baf018a1c2c751a3afb197f2a2e7e870247304402200206ae10cd66267caea1c6e0fca0275924a85fa377572f599304c1abb6a3a97302204335eed108151048de7ba56fd644352831e3d453b412547d8b762f4e96ee1e310121035b6440fe45a8bf7c1d9d238fa39a128ee78b58df73377bfeb1d6d752849714c800000000",
  "timeoutBlockHeight": 252,
  "timeoutEta": 1586353245
}
```

This call works for Normal Submarine Swaps only. If used for Reverse Submarine Swaps, the response will be:

```json
{
	"error": "could not find swap with id: CR8XaB"
}
```

## Broadcasting transactions

This endpoint is used to broadcast transactions on UTXO chains. It is similar to [`/gettransaction`](api.md#raw-transactions) but instead of getting the hex representation of existing transactions on the chain, this call broadcasts _new_ transactions to the network. It is mainly intended to be used to broadcast refund transactions on the user's behalf. It returns the id of the broacasted transaction,which can be used to verify that the refund transaction was broadcasted successfully.

Requests broadcasting transactions have to be `POST` and contain two arguments in the JSON encoded body:

* `currency`: to which network the transaction should be broadcasted
* `transactionHex`: the HEX encoded transaction itself

| URL                          | Response    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| `POST /broadcasttransaction` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `400 Bad Request`: if an argument wasn't provided or the node that should broadcast the transaction returns an error

Response object:

* `transactionId`: the id of the transaction that was broadcasted

**Example:**

`POST /broadcasttransaction`

Request body:

```json
{
  "currency": "BTC",
  "transactionHex": "02000000000101f7ddc247aad2c1e91b2495cf6814aa183b46785cf21f44f43a3c3419c09d377201000000171600142a805e4cfaa6fb79360917a5b0b9c5fcb0dfe6e9ffffffff02938601000000000017a9141137c50104d0814e8663ded75b43ddaa7b9d192b87e8cc96000000000017a9148f6df517d00e650d8c5e6bfa0986b775b256609e870247304402202e8a8572ce3cb232a7b48483bdc280feba7f9cf8c163ac2df091e54dfcf90bb6022042ba2b3e4d89220b3b39b52a444dff2010b22144099aaa348d83301f2ae456be01210341720559e7375a409b03e814415a6c15fc142c5a9e78a83831ff6fe4706d352900000000"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "transactionId": "52ff6682b0bff109e6c6d97de6b6d075f7241c9ac364e02de6315281e423d816"
}
```

There is one special case: when trying to broadcast a refund transaction for a swap that has not timed out yet, the backend will not only return the `error` in the JSON encoded response but also some additional information:

* `error`: the reason for which the broadcasting failed. In this special case always: `non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (Locktime requirement not satisfied) (code 64)`
* `timeoutEta`: UNIX timestamp at which the HTLC is expected to time out
* `timeoutBlockHeight`: block height at which the HTLC in the lockup transaction will time out

**Example:**

`POST /broadcasttransaction`

Request body:

```json
{
  "currency": "BTC",
  "transactionHex": "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"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "timeoutEta": 1586374147,
  "timeoutBlockHeight": 452,
  "error": "non-mandatory-script-verify-flag (Locktime requirement not satisfied) (code 64)"
}
```

## Swap Status

_Before handling status events of this method it is recommended to read:_ [_Swap Types & States_](<README (1).md>)

To query the status of a swap one can use this endpoint which returns a `JSON` object containing the status of the swap. Possible states and status events are documented [here](<README (1).md>).

Requests querying the status of a swap have to be `POST` and contain a single value in its JSON encoded body:

* `id`: the id of the swap of which the status should be queried

| URL                | Response    |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `POST /swapstatus` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `404 Not Found`: if the swap with the provided id couldn't be found
* `400 Bad Request`: if the `id` argument wasn't provided

Response object:

* `status`: status of the swap
* `transaction`: in case of a Reverse Submarine Swap, the lockup transaction details are not in the response of the call which creates the swap. Therefore, the events `transaction.mempool` and `transaction.confirmed` contain it
* `id`: id of the lockup transaction
* `hex`: hex encoded lockup transaction (only set for transactions on UTXO chains)
* `eta`: if the status is `transaction.mempool`, this value is the estimated time of arrival (ETA) in blocks of when the transaction will be confirmed. Only set for transactions on UTXO chains.
* `zeroConfRejected`: set to `true` for Swaps with the status `transaction.mempool` and a lockup transaction that is not eligible for [0-conf](0-confirmation.md)
* `failureReason`: set when it's necessary to further clarify the failure reason

**Examples:**

`POST /swapstatus`

Request body:

```json
{
  "id": "Asnj2Y"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "invoice.paid"
}
```

`POST /swapstatus`

Request body:

```json
{
  "id": "ryUK9G"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "transaction.mempool",

## Swap Status Stream

To avoid querying the [`/swapstatus`](api.md#swap-status) endpoint regularly to get the latest swap status, this endpoint streams swap status updates via [Server-Side events](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5\_serversentevents.asp).

Requests to this endpoint have to provide the required swap `id` parameter via an URL parameter because all requests have to be of the method `GET`.

Every event in the Server-Side stream has data that is encoded exactly like the JSON object of the `/swapstatus` endpoint. Please have a look at the examples below for a reference implementation in JavaScript of handling the stream.

| URL                     | Response                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET /streamswapstatus` | Server-Side event stream |

**Examples:**

Server-Side event streams have to be handled differently from regular HTTP responses. Below is a sample implementation in JavaScript and also what a raw response of a Server-Side event stream looks like.

Sample implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var stream = new EventSource(boltzApi + '/streamswapstatus?id=' + swapId);

source.onmessage = function(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

  console.log('Swap status update:' + data.status);
};
```

Raw response:

```
data: {"status":"transaction.mempool"}

data: {"status":"invoice.paid"}
```

## Creating Swaps

The following request creates a Normal Submarine Swap (Chain -> Lightning). This `POST` request slightly differs depending on the kind of currencies that are swapped. You can find further information on the differences between swapping from UTXO chains and Ethereum underneath. **Please note that Boltz works with 10 \*\* -8 decimals internally** and all amounts in the API endpoints have this denomination regardless of the decimals, regardless of the swapped coin or token.

Also, all kinds of requests to create Swaps have common values in the API request:

* `type`: type of the swap to create; always `submarine` for normal swaps
* `pairId`: the pair on which the swap should be created
* `orderSide`: either `buy` or `sell` depending on what the user wants

If you already know the amount you want to swap you should also set `invoice`.

* `invoice`: the invoice of the user that should be paid

If the amount is **not** known, a **preimage hash should be specified**. The invoice that is [set during the lifecycle of the Submarine Swap](api.md#setting-the-invoice-of-a-swap) has to have the same preimage hash as the one specified when creating the swap.

* `preimageHash`: hash of a preimage that will be used for the invoice that is set later on

In case the client wants to verify the pair data fetched by it is still accurate, the `pairHash` argument can be passed.

* `pairHash`: `hash` string in the pair object of [`/getpairs`](api.md#getting-pairs)

Boltz also supports opening a channel to your node before paying your invoice. To ensure that this service works as advertised **make sure to connect your Lightning node to ours** before creating the swap. You can either query the URIs of our Lightning nodes with [`/getnodes`](api.md#getting-lightning-nodes), find them in the FAQ section of our website or on Lightning explorers like [1ML](https://1ml.com) under the query "Boltz". To let Boltz open a channel to you have to set a couple more values in the request when creating a swap:

* `channel`: a JSON object that contains all the information relevant to the creation of the channel
  * `auto`: whether Boltz should dynamically decide if a channel should be created based on whether the invoice you provided can be paid without opening a channel. More modes will be added in the future
  * `private`: whether the channel to your node should be private
  * `inboundLiquidity`: percentage of the channel balance that Boltz should provide as inbound liquidity for your node. The maximal value here is `50`, which means that the channel will be perfectly balanced 50/50

To find out how to enforce that the requested channel was actually opened and the invoice paid through it have a look at [this document where we wrote down some possible solutions](channel-creation.md).

| URL                | Response    |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `POST /createswap` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `201 Created`
* `400 Bad Request`: if the swap could not be created. Check the `error` string in the JSON object of the body of the response for more information

Response objects:

You will always have these values in the response object:

* `id`: id of the freshly created swap
* `timeoutBlockHeight`: block height at which the swap will be cancelled
* `address`: address in which the coins will be locked up. For UTXO chains this is a SegWit P2SHP2WSH (P2WSH nested in a P2SH) for the sake of compatibility and for Ethereum it is the address of the contract that needs to be used

If you set the invoice you will also have these values in the response:

* `acceptZeroConf`: whether Boltz will accept 0-conf for this swap
* `expectedAmount`: the amount that Boltz expects you to lock in the onchain HTLC

### UTXO Chains

Swaps from UTXO chains like Bitcoin work by deriving an address based on the preimage hash of the invoice and the refund public key of the user and waiting until the user sends coins to that generated address.

Requests have to contain one additional parameter:

* `refundPublicKey`: public key of a keypair that will allow the user to refund the locked up coins once the time lock is expired

Responses also contain one additional value:

* `redeemScript`: redeem script from which the `address` is derived. The redeem script can and should be used to verify that the Boltz instance didn't try to cheat by providing an address without a HTLC

In case the address is for the Liquid network, it will be blinded by a key that is also in the response:

* `blindingKey`: hex encoded private key with which the address was blinded

If the invoice has been set in the request, you will also get this value:

* `bip21`: a [BIP21 payment request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) for the `expectedAmount` of coins and the `address`

**Examples:**

`POST /createswap`

Request body:

```json
{
  "type": "submarine",
  "pairId": "LTC/BTC",
  "orderSide": "sell",
  "refundPublicKey": "03b76c1fe14bab50e52a026f35287fda75b9304bcf311ee85b4d32482400a436f5",

}
```

### Ethereum

Swaps from the Ethereum do not need a new address for every Swap. They work by registering the details of the Swap (like invoice and pair) in our database and waiting until the user locks either Ether in the `EtherSwap` or ERC20 tokens in the `ERC20Swap` contract. The addresses of those contracts can be queried with [`/getcontracts`](http://localhost:8000/api/#getting-contracts) and the address of the contract that needs to be used for the Swap is also in the response of the API request.

The request does not require any additional values.

But the response has one more value:

* `claimAddress`: which is the Ethereum address of Boltz. It has to be specified in the `lock` function of the swap contract

**Examples:**

`POST /createswap`

Request body:

```json
{
  "type": "submarine",
  "pairId": "BTC/USDT",
  "orderSide": "buy",
  "invoice": "lnbcrt1m1p0c26rvpp5hctw8zukj00tsxay5436y43qxc5gwvdc6k9zcxnce4zer7p5a4eqdqqcqzpgsp59mwcr4cj6wq68qj6pzyjtq2j89vnpumsejdmhw5uy4yukq3vd64s9qy9qsq2537ph4kt4xryq27g5juc27v2tkx9y90hpweyqluku9rt5zfexfj6n2fqcgy7g8xx72fklr6r7qul27jd0jzvssvrhxmwth7w4lrq7sqgyv0m7"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "7PSEtx",
  "address": "0xD104195e630A2E26D33c8B215710E940Ca041351",

  "acceptZeroConf": false,
  "expectedAmount": 1387707329,
  "timeoutBlockHeight": 2006
}
```

## Getting Swap rates

When sending onchain coins before setting the invoice of a Submarine Swap, you need to use this endpoint to figure out what the amount of the invoice you set should be. Send a `POST` request with a JSON encoded body with this value:

* `id`: id of the Submarine Swap

| URL               | Response    |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `POST /swaprates` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `400 Bad Request`: if the invoice amount could not be calculated. Check the `error` string in the JSON object of the body of the response for more information

Response object:

* `invoiceAmount`: amount of the invoice that should be set with [/setinvoice](api.md#setting-the-invoice-of-a-swap)

**Examples:**

Request body:

```json
{
  "id": "BY8asG"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "invoiceAmount": 15713393
}
```

## Setting the invoice of a Swap

In case the amount to be swapped is not known when creating the Submarine Swap, the invoice can be set afterward and even if the onchain coins were sent already. Please keep in mind that the invoice of a Submarine Swap **has to have the same preimage hash** that was specified when creating the Submarine Swap. Although the invoice can be changed after setting it initially, this enpoint will only work if Boltz did not try to pay the initial invoice yet. Requests to this endpoint have to be `POST` and should have the following values in its JSON encoded body:

* `id`: id of the Submarine Swap for which the invoice should be set
* `invoice`: invoice of the user that should be paid

| URL                | Response    |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `POST /setinvoice` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `400 Bad Request`: if the invoice could not be set. Check the `error` string in the JSON object of the body of the response for more information

Response objects:

What is returned when the invoice is set depends on the status of the Submarine Swap. If no coins were sent already (status [`swap.created`](<README (1).md#normal-submarine-swaps>)) the endpoint will return a JSON object with these values:

* `acceptZeroConf`: whether Boltz will accept 0-conf for this swap
* `expectedAmount`: the amount that Boltz expects you to lock in the onchain HTLC
* `bip21`: a [BIP21 payment request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) for the `expectedAmount` of coins and the `address` (only set when swapping from UTXO based chains)

If onchain coins were sent already (status [`transaction.mempool`](<README (1).md#normal-submarine-swaps>) or [`transaction.confirmed`](<README (1).md#normal-submarine-swaps>)) the endpoint will return an empty JSON object.

In case this endpoint is called again after an invoice was set and Boltz tried to pay it already:

* `error`: error message explaining that Boltz tried to pay the invoice already and that it cannot be changed anymore
* `invoice`: the invoice that set by the client and will be used for the Submarine Swap

**Examples:**

_If no coins were sent yet:_

`POST /setinvoice`

Request body:

```json

}
```

## Creating Reverse Swaps

Creating reverse swaps (lightning to onchain coins) is pretty similar to creating normal ones. Similarly, the requests and responses also slightly change based on the coin or token you are swapping from. Keep in mind that **Boltz uses 10 \*\* -8 as denomination** in the API.

All requests bodies extend from:

* `type`: type of the swap to create; always `reversesubmarine` for reverse swaps
* `pairId`: the pair on which the swap should be created
* `orderSide`: either `buy` or `sell` depending on what the user wants
* `preimageHash`: the SHA256 hash of a preimage that was generated locally by the client. The size of that preimage has to be 32 bytes or none of locked the coins can get claimed

There are two ways to set the amount of a Reverse Swap. Either by specifying the amount of the invoice Boltz will generate:

* `invoiceAmount`: amount of the invoice that will be generated by Boltz

Or by setting the amount that will be locked in the onchain HTLC. That amount is _not_ what you will actually receive because of the transaction fees required to claim the HTLC. But those can be approximated easily in advance and when overestimating a little, a quick confirmation of the claim transaction can be ensured.

* `onchainAmount`: amount Boltz will lock in the onchain HTLC

In case the client wants to verify the pair data fetched by it is still accurate, the `pairHash` argument can be passed.

* `pairHash`: `hash` string in the pair object of [`/getpairs`](api.md#getting-pairs)

| URL                | Response    |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `POST /createswap` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `201 Created`
* `400 Bad Request`: if the swap could not be created. Check the `error` string in the JSON object of the body of the response for more information

The JSON object in the response extends from:

* `id`: id of the freshly created swap
* `lockupAddress`: address derived from the `redeemScript` or Ethereum contract to which Boltz will lockup coins
* `invoice`: hold invoice that needs to be paid before Boltz locks up coins
* `timeoutBlockHeight`: block height at which the Reverse Swap will be cancelled

In case the invoice amount was specified, the amount that will be locked in the onchain HTLC is also returned:

* `onchainAmount`: amount of onchain coins that will be locked by Boltz

The Boltz backend also supports a different Reverse Swap protocol that requires an invoice for the miner fees to be paid before the actual hold `invoice` of the Reverse Swap. If that protocol is enabled, the response object will also contain `minerFeeInvoice`. Once that `minerFeeInvoice` is paid, Boltz will send the event `minerfee.paid` and when the actual hold `invoice` is paid, the onchain coins will be sent.

### UTXO based chains

The request has to contain one additional value:

* `claimPublicKey`: public key of a keypair that will allow the user to claim the locked up coins with the preimage

And so has the response:

* `redeemScript`: redeem script from which the lockup address was derived. The redeem script can and should be used to verify that the Boltz instance didn't try to cheat by creating an address without a HTLC

In case the lockup address is for the Liquid network, it will be blinded by a key that is also in the response:

* `blindingKey`: hex encoded private key with which the address was blinded

**Examples:**

`POST /createswap`

Request body:

## Authentication

Some API endpoints, like for example [querying referral fees](api.md#querying-referral-fees), require clients to authenticate their requests.

To authenticate your API request, three request headers have to be set:

* `TS`: current UNIX timestamp (can only deviate from server time by 1 minute at most)
* `API-KEY`: your API key
* `API-HMAC`: SHA256 HMAC encoded as HEX of the following values:
  * value of the `TS` header
  * method of the HTTP request (e.g. `GET` or `POST`)
  * request path, including the leading slash (e.g. `/referrals/query`)
  * if the request method is `POST`, the body of the request

TypeScript Node.js example:

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const path = '/referrals/query';

const ts = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
const hmac = createHmac('sha256', argv.secret)
  .update(`${ts}GET${path}`)
  .digest('hex');

try {
  const res = await axios.get(`https://${argv.rest.host}:${argv.rest.port}${path}`, {
    headers: {
      'TS': ts,
      'API-KEY': argv.key,
      'API-HMAC': hmac,
    },
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data, undefined, 2));
} catch (e) {
  const error = e as any;
  console.log(`${error.message}: ${JSON.stringify(error.response.data)}`);
}
```

## Querying referral fees

Boltz partners can request a referral key to get a percentage of the fees earned from Swaps through their integration. To query for their referrals, they can send an [authenticated](api.md#authentication) request to this endpoint.

| URL                    | Response    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /referrals/query` | JSON object |

Status Codes:

* `200 OK`
* `401 Unauthorized`: missing or invalid request authentication

Response object:

The response of a valid request is grouped by year, month and referral key. The amounts are denominated in 10 \*\* -8.

**Examples:**

`GET /referrals/query`

Response:

```json
{
  "2021": {
    "9": {
      "cliTest": {
        "BTC": 60
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ethereum

The request has to contain one additional value:

* `claimAddress`: address from which the coins will be claimed

The response also has one more property:

* `refundAddress`: the address of Boltz which is specified as refund address when it is locking coins

Also, Boltz offers an optional protocol called Ethereum prepay miner fee to send some Ether to the `claimAddress` in the lockup process. That is useful in cases the `claimAddress` does not have the Ether required to claim the coins already. To use that protocol set the following property in the request body to `true`.

* `prepayMinerFee`: if the Ethereum prepay miner fee protocol should be used for the Reverse Swap

When the Ethereum prepay miner fee protocol is used the response will contain two more values. One is the amount of Ether that will be sent to `claimAddress` in the lockup process. The other is an invoice for the Ether sent. Only when both invoices are paid the onchain coins will get locked.

* `prepayMinerFeeAmount`: amount of Ether that will be sent to the `claimAddress` with the lockup transaction from Boltz
* `minerFeeInvoice`: invoice that pays for the Ether sent in the lockup process

**Examples:**

`POST /createswap`

Request body:

```json
{
  "type": "reversesubmarine",
  "pairId": "BTC/USDT",
  "orderSide": "sell",
  "claimAddress": "0x88532974EC20559608681A53F4Ac8C34dd5e2804",
