# ðŸ›Ÿ Swap Restore

Swap Restore is a recovery flow for situations where all local swap state and
any client backups have been lost. Swap Restore enables refunding failed swaps
as well as resuming ongoing swaps. It works only when swap keys were originally
derived from an xpub.

This mechanism targets UTXOâ€‘based chains. On EVM chains, swap parameters are
persisted onâ€‘chain in contract event logs. Recovery on EVM is performed by
reading those logs instead of using Swap Restore. For more details, see the
[EVM contract logs section](./claiming-swaps.md#evm-chains).

## What Swap Restore Does

At a high level, Swap Restore means the client submits the xpub used for
[key derivation](#key-derivation) to `/v2/swap/restore`, receives all associated
swaps, and reconstructs the local data. With that state restored, the app can
perform claims for ongoing swaps or refunds for failed ones as needed. For
claims to work, the client also needs to be able to deterministically derive
preimages. One option to do that is to
[hash the private key of a swap and use that hash as the preimage](#preimages).

## Trust Model

The private keys never leave the device and remain clientâ€‘side. The backend only
receives the xpub, which cannot be used to derive private keys or spend funds.
All transaction signing happens locally. Sharing an xpub links your swap history
to the Boltz Backend, but it cannot spend your funds.

## API

Call
[`POST /v2/swap/restore`](https://api.boltz.exchange/swagger#/Swap/post_swap_restore)
with the xpub in the request body:

```json
{
  "xpub": "xpub6C..."
}
```

The API will respond with an array of swaps belonging to that xpub. A simplified
example shape is shown below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "type": "submarine|reverse|chain",
    "status": "transaction.lockupFailed",
    "from": "BTC",
    "to": "LBTC",
    ...
  }
]
```

## Key Derivation

Starting from a mnemonic, derive a seed and then a BIP32 root. From there,
derive the account at `m/44/0/0/0` (the default path) and export its xpub for
serverâ€‘side swap matching. Individual swap keys are derived at
`m/44/0/0/0/{index}`. This default path must be used for implementations to work
with the Web App, though a different derivation path can be specified when using
the API directly.

### Preimages

We deterministically derive preimages with `sha256(privateKey(index))`. This
allows swaps to be fully restored from the mnemonic alone. Using deterministic
preimages in this exact way is necessary for restored swaps to be claimable in
our Web App.
