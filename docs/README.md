# Introduction

## Instances

We are running and maintaining two Boltz instances that can be used - one on [testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange) and one on [mainnet](https://boltz.exchange).

The Rest API can be accessed at:

* [Testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api)
* [Mainnet](https://api.boltz.exchange)

> Note: If you access the API from your browser, you will get 404. Run `curl https://api.boltz.exchange/version`, (or `curl https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/version` for testnet) to check that it is available.
