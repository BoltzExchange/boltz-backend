# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## Instances

We offer Boltz on [testnet](https://testnet.boltz.exchange) for development and testing purposes as well as our production service on [mainnet](https://boltz.exchange).

The corresponding REST API can be accessed at:

* `https://api.boltz.exchange/`
* `https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/`

> Note: To access the API from your browser, simply append an [endpoint](api.md) to the address, e.g.:
>
> [`https://api.boltz.exchange/version`](https://api.boltz.exchange/version) or
>
> [`https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/version`](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/api/version)
