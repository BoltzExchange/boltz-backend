# ðŸ“© Refund Files

The concept of refunds currently only exists for failed Normal Submarine Swaps. In case of a failed Reverse Submarine Swaps, Lightning funds automatically bounce back to the user, no active refunding is needed. All clients that offer the option for users to save refund files should format them in a standardized way. This is necessary for refunds to not only work in a client, but also but also with the [Boltz Web App](https://boltz.exchange/refund).

## Refund Files

The refund files Boltz Web App generates are `JSON` on Desktop and `PNG` QR codes on mobile because iOS browsers don't allow any other files than images to be downloaded. Boltz parses files with other extension than `.json` and `.png` and treats them as raw `JSON`.

The data that should be in the file or encoded in the QR code is a `JSON` object with the following values:

* `id`: the ID of the swap
* `currency`: symbol of the chain on which bitcoin were locked up
* `redeemScript`: the redeem script of the lockup address
* `privateKey`: the private key of the refund key pair
* `timeoutBlockHeight`: block height at which the swap times out

The values of `id`, `redeemScript` and `timeoutBlockHeight` are returned by the Boltz API when the Swap is created. `currency` and `privateKey` are known by the client already.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "qZf1Zb",
  "currency": "BTC",
  "redeemScript": "a9146a24b142de20b50871a247c1c66a6e41ee199017876321038ce1d1be5a22b396ccafc109c86717bc081301fe58d1958546d5aba647047af3670381a81ab1752102d23a7d39395f40a71a490cf79e0f2df5da2fb006fdab660bc0c78ef0c9ba457668ac",
  "privateKey": "1736eb52267524619289a5c9b58dab9339b2bb389764ad5c5be8955d9aadeeab",
  "timeoutBlockHeight": 1747073
}
```
